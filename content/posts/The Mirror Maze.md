 # ***The Mirror Maze***

> “*Mirror mirror on the wall, whose the fairest of them all”*

### *Mirrors*, the shiny surfaces that show it all, have always fascinated me. The science behind *mirrors* is simple but the illusion it creates is **magical**. Hence, when the opportunity presented itself to renovate our college cafeteria, my first thought was to create an indulging ***Mirror Maze***.

 ## ***The Idea***

#### ***Mirror mazes*** are quirky and fun and therefore it was a task to maintain a theme to make it an engaging and memorable *experience*. I contacted several **art enthusiasts** and requested some of my architect friends to help us with the blueprints of the maze. Though we did not have a budget constraint, **time was limited,** and we tried to quickly **formulate our ideas**. 


> *"Mirrors hold a world within themselves, a world that is full of fantasies and mysteries."*

## ***The Execution*** 


Huge ***shiny mirrors*** were ordered, steel sheets were brought to create the structure, paints, lights and all the other tools were arranged to create the ***epic maze***. *Technology also played a great role in modelling the structure*.
After hours of toiling, the maze was in place. Our reconstruction was magnificent, and the cafeteria was unrecognisable. We eagerly waited to **open the maze for the public**.

## ***The Response***



**The maze was a hit**. Everyone loved it. It was planned in such a way that you could spend hours in it without feeling **claustrophobic**. In addition to solving the  maze, we had also given provisions for people to carry out **several engaging activities** making it a wholesome experiance.
