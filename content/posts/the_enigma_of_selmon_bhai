Either a student or a member of the faculty, if you want to do some work while munching down snacks, it might be the best place for you. But what made it the place that it is currently? The mythical ***Selmon Bhai***, who single-handedly changed the way _Annapurna_ operates...

_Selmon Bhai_ was a first-year student at ***JIIT***. His branch was unknown, and he used to hang with students from every branch. His enginma and extrovertedness were the things that drew in people. He met ***Aishwarya***, the college's most beautiful freshman, in the _Annapurna_. They started dating shortly after. His popularity was boosted throughout the college.
One day, after a series of tiring lectures, _Selmon Bhai_ decided to eat chole bhature from Annapurna. But the problem was that he didn't have ***UPI***. After getting rough treatment from caterers at Annapurna, Selmo Bhai felt infuriated. He said the caterer to meet him on the footpath.

Not knowing who he was, the caterer laughed it off. The next day, _Selmon Bhai_ came, and the caterer was accepting cash payments. Nobody knows what happened, and that still remains a mystery. From that day onwards, _Selmon Bhai's_ reputation skyrocketed. He was even getting stares from even the senior female students. That made _Aishwarya_ jealous. _Selmon Bhai_, enjoying his newfound popularity, became unfaithful to _Aishwarya_. She broke up with him on _Annapurna_ itself. But that didn't hurt Selmon Bhai a bit, as he was head over heels for another girl, ***Nirjara***. She was a second-year BBA student. She was a gentle breeze in the harsh world of _Selmon Bhai_. But as someone said, we can't have nice things in the world. Knowing his reputation, _Nirjara_ rejected _Selmon Bhai_. He became dejected.

_Aishwarya_ also complained about him to her brother. He was beaten by him just outside _Annapurna_. _Selmon bhai_ was at an all-time low. He knew that his time at JIIT had come to an end. He vanished into thin air and remains _Annapurna's_ most enigmatic figure.

To this day, when the caterer doesn't accept cash payments at _Annapurna_, just the mention of _Selmon Bhai_ sends shivers down his spine...
