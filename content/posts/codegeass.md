This story is based on a very famous anime `Code Geass` so it may be a spoiler for some people 

## Sacrifice of anti-hero

There once was a _teenager_, who wanted to bring peace in the world. **Britanian Empire** was ruling over the world. They were ruthless and opressive. **Lelouch Lamperouge**, the teenager was a very intelligent student and seeked power so as to bring down the Britanian Empire. 

One day an angel came and gave him a power, a power which commanded people to follow his order. The power only had one major flaw, that it could only be used once on a single person. As he was very clever he designed a plan to obliterate the Britaninan Empire. 

The head of Britanian also possesed a power which made the citiznes like him. So Lelouch came up with a magnificent plan.

He architectured a master-plan which saw him destroying peace of Britanian Empire and bringing all the hate of the world onto him. He decided that if he dies, the peace will restore and the world will be happy place to live again. 

Lelouch sacrificed himself and the world became a _happy place_ :)
