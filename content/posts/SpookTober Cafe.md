Today was a rather unusual day . I was scurrying around campus avoiding the 
_uniform inspectors_ who literally fine people for not wearing the same old blue 
shirt over and over everyday.Then when i thought I just made it away from them,
I was approached by MIB or maybe just some  people in black suits who knows.

They asked for my identity and told me to follow them.Was I gonna say no 
to these handsome hunks of men in beautiful fitted suits ? Well ~~I should have~~ 
but Iâ€™m stupid so I just moved along.They took me in a room and sat me 
down.I just finished Stranger things season 2 and the _Deja Vu_ didnt hit well.

While I was scared for my life,something unusual happened.They told me that I
was being given the opportunity to renovate the cafe for a day. Yes , the **same cafe** 
which doesnt take cash and then UPI doesnt even work so they _force us to beg_ some 
rich kid to use their card.They even told me I had unlimited resources and budget and 
well that just took me over the moon.

I just had too many ideas tho.Then again it was october and I like to get it **spooky**. 
Not diwali tho too many firecrackers and then I _cough like a weasel_ .So I decided
to make it a haunted house or cafe whatever seemed logical . Now it would have all
the typical haunted house voodoo - skeletons , people jumping out , blood yada yada.

## But I had **unlimited budget** 
and then it hit me.I would invite
 **Nicolas Cage** (THE GHOST RIDER  HECK YEAHH) and then maybe Micheal myers or Frankenstein or both.

I was also thinking about this teacher I had in the 2nd year who shall remain _unnamed_ ;).
That woman **really** scared the shit out of me.Then we could have halloween themed snacks
like red drinks cause _blood is important_ or like weird crackers .So like half the cafe is a haunted house 
with a maze type thingy and most people would ~~chicken out~~ so only the people who made 
it through would get to join the freakin party.**THE PARTAAYY WOULD BE THE REAL DEAL.**
There would be a **DJ**(_hopefully a dracula looking one_) with daunting tunes and remixes, a shape shifting mind boggling dance floor,holograms,vfx,jack-o-lanterns **you name it**.
There would even be a custom halloween costume designing area with like tony stark tech so
awesome designs and stuff

THEN A FREAKIN CAFE WHICH ACCEPTS CASH AND UPI AND EVEN FUCKING BITCOIN . Although I doubt _the bitcoin part_ but yessss. So yeah a custom themed halloween haunted house with lots of crazy cameos , events, activities and an all-you-can-eat buffet cause thats what _attracts_ us Indian folks the most? I dont know you tell me.
