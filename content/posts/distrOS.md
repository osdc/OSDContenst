# My first "real" Open-Source experience (⌐■_■)

In order to _truly_ understand how things came to be, how history played out, one would require to travel back to the day it began.

### Tuesday, July 12, 2022
#### 6:09 pm
It's a Tuesday evening. A very _nice_ one at that too. Atleast for the time being.

#### 30 mins later, 6:39 pm
You see, because it's not just a Tuesday evening. Nay, it's _the_ Tuesday evening. 
Imagine a very cool boi. Now, if only you could imagine him any cooler you'll have some idea of what I'm talking about. 
He was sitting in his room, his laptop and a bag of Doritos by his side, slashin away as he did a routine survey of my Realm, the Realm of the Browsing. His head filled with all sorts of ideas as usual. Ideas, yes. Ideas come and go. Staying, for less than a moment, yet ever so impactful. Ideas, yes. That's how it all began. With an idea.

# There was an idea...

## “A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on. Ideas have endurance without death.” ― John F. Kennedy

Little does he know his . and an idea strikes

And this, this is the first known indication of any hint or indication of how things would change.

And this was not all, not even close.

There was no stopping him from transcending to higher levels of bad humor.

This won't come across as a surprise but there were no signs of _any_ opposition to the idea. Far from it infact, it wasn't long before other _gentlemensch_ decided to join in.

And then came another idea. However you see, this time, it did not come from our _impossibly_ cool protagonist. In fact, it was none other than someone who Akshit had one of his encounters with before. Times were different then. It was a cold dark alley and Akshit in his trenchcoat and a sheet of paper in his backpocket had managed to track down his target. Perhaps it would be more accurate to call things for what they truly were, at that moment there was no Akshit, there was only Detective Shit. And the detective's target, the one who'll be there to combine an *idea* of his own on top of an *idea* already so groundbreaking, it would lead the detective down a path with consequences of magnitude the universe had never witnessed before. It was: Senor Poop.

# There was another...

Scholars kept adding in. The idea had started to get the right kind of attention.

The movement kept on growing:

# This is not a story of that unimaginably and impossibly cool boi, nor is it about Poop or about JOOS, ths story is about the repository that attracted worldwide attention. Behold 'distrOS' as it appeared during mid-2022:

parts of the manuscript were lost and this is all we have been able to recover till now...
